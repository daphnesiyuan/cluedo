cluedo
======
An assignment I did for the course SWEN221 at Victoria University of Wellington, 2014.
This assignment was worked in pairs, and we implemented a simple game of cluedo with Java.
Antonia Caskey and I worked on this together, it was our first time working with JFrames and UI classes with Java. A huge focus for this assignment was getting a feel for creating a game, writing logic and playing with UI features. Along with this assignment we wrote CRC cards, and Imade sequence diagrams and class diagrams with online UML generators which contributed to our assignment.
Overall we achieved the grade of A-. Classes we worked on are labelled at the top of each class with java doc.
